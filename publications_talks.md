### Other

[Astrobites](https://astrobites.org/) is a grad student-run, AAS supported blog that summarizes recent astrophysical research papers at an undergraduate level.
I was an author and editor for 2 years, and wrote 14 astrobites - [here they are!](https://astrobites.org/author/jsullivan/) I also servied as editorial co-chair, developing editorial guidelines, editing and posting 100+ undergraduate research and guest post submissions, and managing the editorial committee.

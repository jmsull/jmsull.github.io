**Under construction!**

I was a co-instructor at [Mount Tamalpais College](https://www.mttamcollege.edu/) (MTC) from and taught college credit Intermediate Algebra, Physics I with Lab, and Statistics courses from January 2022 to May 2023. 
In 2022, MTC became the [first accredited junior college](https://apnews.com/article/prisons-education-california-nationalism-6d12a7d53cafe3763014f897f83f076f) inside a state prison system.
Please get in touch if you would like to know more or are interested in volunteering!

I was also a Graduate Student Instructor at UC Berkeley for [ASTRON C10](https://classes.berkeley.edu/content/2023-fall-astron-c10-001-lec-001) (Introduction to General Astronomy). GSI-ing for this course was my formative teaching experience, though I also was an undegraduate [Physical Sciences](https://catalog.utexas.edu/general-information/coursesatoz/p-s/) TA and [research mentor](https://fri.cns.utexas.edu/research-streams/white-dwarf-stars) at UT Austin.

I have also taught an introductory course for high-school students on basic concepts in cosmology semesterly since Fall 2021 through the 1-day [SPLASH Berkeley](https://berkeley.learningu.org/) event.

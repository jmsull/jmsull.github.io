I'm Jamie Sullivan, a cosmology PhD student at Berkeley working with [Uro≈° Seljak](https://physics.berkeley.edu/people/faculty/uros-seljak) in the [Berkeley Center for Cosmological Physics](http://bccp.berkeley.edu/people/). 

I build numerical models of large-scale structure and try to learn something from them along the way. Some of that learning from modern statistical inference tools, which I've also spent some time developing.
I'm an author of the differentiable Boltzmann solver [Bolt](https://github.com/xzackli/Bolt.jl) (with Zack Li). I'm also a contributor to the high-performance N-body simulation code [HACC](https://cpac.hep.anl.gov/projects/hacc/). To see more of my code (at your own risk) head over to my [github page](https://github.com/jmsull).
I'm currently a [DoE Office of Science Graduate Student Research](https://science.osti.gov/wdts/scgsr) awardee, and was a [DoE Computational Science Graduate Fellow](https://www.krellinst.org/csgf/) for 4 years prior.

While in the Bay area, I've had the wonderful experience of serving as STEM faculty at [Mount Tamalpais College](https://www.mttamcollege.edu/) for a couple of years. Through MTC, I've taught Intermediate Algebra, Physics I (with Lab), and Statistics in San Quentin State Prison as lecturer/co-instructor once a week.

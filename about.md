I'm Jamie Sullivan, a [Brinson Prize Fellow](https://brinsonfoundation.org/brinson-prize-fellowship-program/) hosted at MIT in the [Center for Theoretical Physics](https://physics.mit.edu/research/labs-centers/center-for-theoretical-physics/).

I build numerical models of large-scale structure and try to learn something physical from them along the way. Some of that learning comes from modern statistical inference tools, which I've also spent some time developing.
I'm an author of the differentiable Boltzmann solver [Bolt](https://github.com/xzackli/Bolt.jl) (with [Zack Li](https://zack.li/)). I'm also a contributor to the high-performance N-body simulation code [HACC](https://cpac.hep.anl.gov/projects/hacc/). To see more of my code (at your own risk) head over to my [github page](https://github.com/jmsull).

I was previously a PhD student in the [Berkeley Center for Cosmological Physics](https://bccp.berkeley.edu/people/) working with [Uro≈° Seljak](https://physics.berkeley.edu/people/faculty/uros-seljak) where I was a [DoE Computational Science Graduate Fellow](https://www.krellinst.org/csgf/) and a [DoE Office of Science Graduate Student Research](https://science.osti.gov/wdts/scgsr) awardee.

While in the Bay area, I had the wonderful experience of serving as STEM faculty at [Mount Tamalpais College](https://www.mttamcollege.edu/) for a couple of years. Through MTC, I taught Intermediate Algebra, Physics I (with Lab), and Statistics for college credit in San Quentin State Prison as lecturer/co-instructor.

Some of my talk slides and paper links can be found [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/publications_talks/).
